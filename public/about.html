<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm making my way through App Brewery's Web Development Bootcamp on Udemy, and this is where I'm displaying all my projects. 
  I learned HTML and CSS a bit ago, so I'm getting a little impatient to try Javascript and hopefully move on to some proper coding!</p>

<p>My pathway to this program is a little unusual. I'm currently a stay-at-home mom with a baby boy, and I'm learning how to code while I have childcare.
  I have a degree in history, and while I had the immense privilege of working at Monticello, have mostly worked as an office admin.
While I'm grateful for the transferable skills I learned running an office, it was never something I enjoyed. I missed the analytic side
of historical research, and I've always learning and problem-solving. </p>

<p>I've been an internet addict since my family got broadband back in the early 2000s and had learned HTML and CSS for fun in the past, 
but it was during the COVID-19 shutdown that I realized this could be a career. I was transferred temporarily to the digital content team at 
Monticello where I helped develop a self-guided tour of the Thomas Jefferson's home. I did the bulk of the writing and used Monticello's 
pre-built website to create a written tour people could follow along with on their cell phones. Not only did I love the work, it made me 
want to learn more: how to build apps from the ground up. Now, with a little more education on the subject, I also want to make them
as user-friendly as possible through the theory of human-computer interation, UX research, and an emphasis on accessability.</p>

<p>When I aspire to my highest self, I love reading (mostly fantasy, but also horror and science fiction), drawing, watercolor painting, 
historically-inspired hand-sewing; traditional archery; and learning everything I can about everything (but especially history and 
natural science). More realistically, I watch a lot of TV and spend a lot of time reading to a baby who just wants to eat the books.</p>
