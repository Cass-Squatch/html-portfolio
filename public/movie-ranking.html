<h1>The Best Movies According to Cassie</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All-Time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Everything, Everywhere, All At Once</h3>
<p>This film makes me laugh and cry within the same scenes. I relate to Evelyn's collection of failed hobbies, embrace it's philosophy of cheerful nihilism, and I aspire to fight with kindness like Waymond. While I connect to it deeply on a personal level, it's an excellently casted and crafted film with just my style of artsy silliness.</p>
<h3>The Lord of the Rings Trilogy</h3>
<p>I don't think this counts as a favorite "movie," but I can't pick just one. I believe this is the greatest series of films ever made. It's also personally special to myself and my husband.</p>
<h3>Amelie</h3>
<p>It's basically a perfect film. An artistically shot film about shyness, kindness, and two weirdos finding each other in a whimsical and idealized Paris.</p>

<h2>Honorable Mentions</h2>
<h3>Labyrinth</h3>
<p>While there are other films of higher quality, this is a special childhood favorite that forever influenced my tastes. I would give it my personal lifetime achievement award.</p>
<h3>Underrated Favorites</h3>
<p>October Sky, Pleasantville, Gattaca. I never hear people talk about these but they are excellent.</p>
<h3>My "Morning Movies"</h3>
<p>"Morning Movies" is my term for calm, comforting films perfect for slow mornings and stressful times. While there are several, I've easily watched these films the most: Jane Eyre (2011), Pride and Prejudice (2005), Little Women (2019), Ever After, and Practical Magic.</p>
